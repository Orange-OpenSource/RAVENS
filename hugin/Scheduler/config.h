/*
 * Optimizations:
 *
 * Our main benchmark was forthPassTest() which is a complex network to resolve.
 * The metric we're trying to optimize in the number of operations (a side effect is to reudce the number of COPY which are very large opcodes)
 * Similar improvements were noticed in our other tests.
 *
 * 	Initial instructions #				: 59
 * 	+CODEGEN_OPTIMIZATIONS				: 48 (extremely efficient on benchmarks, likely less so in real world scenarios)
 *	+AVOID_UNECESSARY_REWRITE			: 41
 *	+IGNORE_BLOCK_LAYOUT_UNLESS_FINAL	: 39
 *	+IGNORE_CACHE_LAYOUT				: 39 (useful for forthPassTestWithCompetitiveRead)
 *
 *	Each optimization can be enabled or disabled individually and aren't dependant of each other unless #ifdefed
