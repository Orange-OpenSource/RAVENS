# Syntax  
  
- `[BLOCK_ID]`: a NAND page number, computed from an address by ignoring the lowest `blockOffsetBits` bits. The `USE_BLOCK` instruction may cause this information not to be explicitely encoded, as it is then be implied by the preceding `USE_BLOCK`. Only the first BlockID may then be skipped using this approach. Although by default encoded in `blockIDBits` bits, the encoded length can be shortened by the use of the `REBASE` instruction's second argument;  
  
- `[Length]`: 	An integer of length `lengthBits`, that must be â‰¥ to `blockOffsetBits`. Used to encode length of copies; 
  
- `[Offset]`:	An integer of length `blockOffsetBits`. Used to encode NAND page offsets;  
  
- `[Length-x]`:	An integer of length `#x` bits. Used when numbers smaller than a full length have to be encoded.
